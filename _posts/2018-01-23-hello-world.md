Hello all and welcome to my blog! This is where I will post recent analysis I have been working on and at times give updates on my life and career! Be sure to check back regularly as content will come often.

In other news, today is the first day of my last semester in the Masters of Scinece in Data Science at The University of Wisconsin - La Crosse (that's a mouthful...). I have appreciated the time I have spent in the program to this point and have learned an immense amount, I'm sure this last semester will continue to be a welcom challenge where I will learn a lot. Feel free to contact me if you have an interest in the program and what it all entails.

Till next time!
