## About

I am currently a Marketing Data Analyst within the Customer Analytics group at Tractor Supply Co., my work is focused on extracting meaning and interpreting customer data.

As a well-rounded Data Science professional, I employ the latest tools and analytical methods to clean, organize, analyze, and interpret structured and unstructured data. I am adept at clearly communicating discoveries to stakeholders using sophisticated visualization techniques and other data representations.

I also possess expertise in areas such as data mining, warehousing, predictive analytics, statistical modeling, database infrastructures and data management, machine learning, and analytics-based decision making. 

I have received an MS in Data Science from The University of Wisconsin - La Crosse and a BS in Informatics from The University of Iowa. I love to learn and strongly believe that continuous education is important for all professionals data focused or otherwise.
